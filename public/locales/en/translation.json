    "3": "What's this ?",
    "4": "A platform to allow you to carry out your real estate project. We have found that many buyers and sellers are guided only by the prices displayed and their intuition. They lack factual information to determine the market value of real estate. This translates into a waste of time and money. At Ziaway we offer you free and instantly the market value calculated from the actual sales prices. We have developed many algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence with a single objective: To provide you with the tools that are useful for the successful completion of your project. The success of a project involves the involvement of several partners; we want you to choose the most relevant partners for your project and thus create a synergy with high added value.

    "24": "Where does your data come from? are they up to date?",
    "25": "Real estate data (excluding advertisements) comes from key public or private players in Canada. We update them in Ziaway following their update in their reference base. The update time may be a few hours to a few weeks depending on the quantity and quality of the baseline data. The various Ziaway indicators are designed and calculated on the basis of this reference data and are updated regularly in order to best represent the current real estate situation.",
    "26": "How do you estimate the price of a property?",
    "27": "The property estimation algorithm developed by Ziaway is based on the cadastral and land characteristics of each property (its living area in the case of a house, etc.) as well as on its geographical area. The <<charm>> aspects, recent renovations ... are not taken into account (for the moment at least). A confidence index is associated with each estimate. It sometimes happens that very few properties of a certain type have been sold / rented in a given area, making it difficult to estimate. The confidence index will then be low. On the contrary, when many properties of the same type have been sold / rented in the same area, the estimate is reliable and the confidence index will be maximum.",
    "28": "How is the similarity of comparables between properties calculated",
    "29": "Similarity evaluates transactions (actual sales) that have occurred in the same geographic area in order to provide you with those concerning the properties that most closely resemble your current search. This evaluation is based on the main characteristics of each property considered but also on the freshness of the transaction associated with it.",
    "30": "What is the confidence index used for?",
    "31": "Ziaway displays a confidence index in addition to its estimates. The more information we have, the higher the confidence index will be. This index must always be taken into account with regard to the market value of the property. Indeed, a confidence index of less than 60% indicates that we do not yet have enough information, and that our estimate should be viewed with some caution. This does not mean that the displayed price is a bad price, but simply that we are not in an optimal situation in terms of the information available.

    "32": "How often are Ziaway's prices updated?",
    "33": "Ziaway updates market values ​​at least once a month.",

    "41": "Why are indicators not available on certain goods?",
    "42": "Each indicator is based on the recent real estate market. Thus, it sometimes happens that an insufficient number of transactions have taken place in a given sector, making the indicator difficult to estimate reliably. When this scenario arises and the reliability of our estimates is called into question, the associated confidence indices are strongly penalized (0/5) and we therefore choose not to provide you with these estimates.",
    "43": "How to report a data error on an asset?",
    "44": "If you notice a data error on a property, you can let us know via the contact form <<Contact us>> located at the bottom of the page."
